Due to copyright reasons, the dataset could not be kept in this repository. The reader who wants to reproduce the results have to recreate the dataset:
- one file per house, named after the id of the house. The file "index.txt" contains the list of required houses.
- Only the house with id 1002 has been kept, for the example: one line is composed of the time (hours since time 0 UTC, and the consumption of the house for this hour).
